    "# Intro to Python: Practice Final Assignment\"\n",
    "Welcome to the assignment for the Introduction into Python 2020 MSc course.\n",
    "The grade for this assignment will be your final grade for this part of the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will use this jupyter notebook on your computer to make the exam. During and when you **finish** your assignment **\"save\"** your progress as an **.ipynb** file. \n",
    "- For the final assignmnet when finished, **email** your Jupyter **notebook file** (.ipynb) to **xxxxx**. \n",
    "- If not possible, raise your hand and someone will come over to download your jupyter notebook and store it on a usb-stick. \n",
    "- Also keep the file on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Change the name of the notebook to include your student number!\n",
    "Click on **Assignment** in the filename shown next to the Jupyter logo in the top left corner.\n",
    "**Don't forget to fill in your name and student number in the notebook as well!**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Ground rules:\n",
    "- Obvious rules on cheating apply. No peaking at your neighbors' screens, no online/offline communications with people. Etc. This includes posting your problem on stackoverflow or similar.\n",
    "- You can use online python documentation and \"google\" to look up what functions do and how they are to be used.\n",
    "    - But you can not communicate with anyone online or offline about your exam!\n",
    "- You have until 15:00 to complete the assignment\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tips:\n",
    "- Cheatsheets!\n",
    "- If the question provides code, make a copy in case you make a mistake.\n",
    "- **Save regularly!**\n",
    "- Make use of a new cell when needed, its the plus button under \"file\" on top of your screen\n",
    "- <u>**Use comments to explain what you are trying to do.*** If the code doesn't work (correctly) you can still get points for your reasoning!</u>\n",
    "\n",
    "## If you are having trouble with your jupyter notebook, check the error message, raise your hand if you need help to fix it. \n",
    "\n",
    "Good luck!"
